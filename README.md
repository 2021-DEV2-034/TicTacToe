# Tic Tac Toe

## About this Kata

This short and simple Kata should be performed using **Test Driven Development** (TDD).

## Rules

The rules are described below :

- X always goes first.
- Players cannot play on a played position.
- Players alternate placing X’s and O’s on the board until either:
	- One player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally
	- All nine squares are filled.
- If a player is able to draw three X’s or three O’s in a row, that player wins.
- If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.

## Solution

I have programmed a simple solution to the Tic Tac Toe game with a TDD approach. 

To run the project simply clone this repository and run the project with Xcode in any simulator. The project does not have any dependencies or third party libraries.

Tests have been made for the most significant cases and a very simple UI has been added to test the game.
